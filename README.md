# The ConCHa Project

The ConCHa Project is a collection of Python packages focused on the Galaxy–Halo Connection. Its acronym stands for _Connecting Cosmological Halos and galaxies_, and it owes its name to the _tradicional pan dulce Mexicano_ (traditional Mexican sweet bread), which in turn is named after a seashell due to its shape.

For more information about this typical _pan dulce_, visit the [Wikipedia website](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concha).
