# The ConCHa Project

The ConCHa Project is a collection of Python packages focused on the Galaxy–Halo Connection. Its acronym stands for _Connecting Cosmological Halos and galaxies_, and it owes its name to the traditional Mexican _pan dulce_ (sweet bread), which in turn is named after a seashell due to its shape.
